# Reflection question 1
If a property is not found within an object it is evaluated to `undefined` 
when trying to be read. Because of falsy characteristics `undefined === false`. 

# Reflection question 2
`for..in` iteration of js object iterates over enumerable properties both inherited and own.
`Object.keys()` fetches only own enumerable properties. The function `sort()` is a prototype
function from `Array`.
